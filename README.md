Since the task involves using a timer for the most part, my plan for this is to make some shapes move at for an interval and when the interval is over, a different shape will pop up. Like a jumpscare of sort.

Update nevermind, I decided to go with something simple. I used quad which I didn't know much about so I just skimmed the reference page (https://p5js.org/reference/p5/quad/). With quad I made some sort of shape that was similar to a butterfly. I then used setTimeout for the butterfly and put it on a timer of 2 seconds, I also used the mousePressed function to allow the user to create butterflies.

I also used arc to make a Pacman shape but I couldn't figure out how to angle it to make actually look like Pacman so I used an arc form which made it look like Pacman was looking up from the arc reference page(https://p5js.org/reference/p5/arc/). For Pacman I placed it in the setInterval function and put the interval as 50 milliseconds so that the Pacmen would appear every 50 milliseconds.
